# Q5 — concrete PyMDP artifact proof

Status: **native proof and applicable Python/coverage gates verified**.
Evidence date: 2026-09-04. See the [delivery report](REPORT.md) for exact
receipt hashes, observed results, and remaining checks.

Q5 connects the five literal tables in one current, canonically rendered
PyMDP runner to the accepted Q2 Boolean denotation and Q4 matrix statement.
A second, handcrafted asymmetric fixture exercises the same static proof
construction. The [GNN bridge contract](../../docs/design/gnn-bridge/bridge-contract.md)
continues to separate source custody, rendering, static extraction, native
proof, numerical comparisons, and runtime execution.

## What the proof establishes

For the retained symmetric runner, the extracted `A_data`, `B_data`,
`C_data`, `D_data`, and `E_data` tables equal the independently authored
`FEP.GnnDenotation.symBoolPayload`. Their entries equal the corresponding
carrier masses of its denotation. The likelihood entries also recover the
original `symmetricBoolModel trueBiasedPolicyPrior` through the accepted
`symBoolDoc_denotation` theorem.

The Q4 `Statement5Pymdp` theorem is an implication from table faithfulness
to the matrix statement. Q5 separately proves that faithfulness and applies
the implication in `symArtifact_carrierMasses`; the implication alone is
not evidence that an arbitrary runner has correct tables.

The asymmetric proof establishes equality to its separately authored,
fixed `asymExpectedPayload`, together with named differences from the
symmetric payload. These two concrete results do not prove correctness of
the extractor, renderer, arbitrary models, or a Python-to-Lean compiler.
Neither retained runner is imported or executed by Q5 verification. There
is no C/EFE equivalence, runtime behavior, physical, or H3 claim.

## Artifacts and evidence

| Artifact | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [Symmetric runner](fixtures/pymdp_symmetric_runner.py) | Actual output of the current canonical GNN render route |
| [Asymmetric runner](fixtures/pymdp_asymmetric_runner.py) | Handcrafted normalized dyadic control, not a second live-render result |
| [Render provenance](render_provenance.json) | Actual renderer command/output, input/output digests, and unchanged before/after owner bindings |
| [Generated manifest](generated/artifact_proof_manifest.json) | Extracted rational table summary and fixture/extractor/probe digests |
| [Symmetric probe](generated/probe_symmetric.lean) | Four concrete theorems on the Boolean carrier |
| [Asymmetric probe](generated/probe_asymmetric.lean) | Two concrete theorems for the control fixture |
| [Native receipt](native_receipt.json) | Successful native transcripts, six axiom reports, source bindings, and compiled-import hashes |

The retained fixtures support sibling-independent static tests. Checking
current renderer/source custody additionally requires the explicitly
selected GNN checkout and the current
[source pin](../gnn-bridge-w2-source-custody/source-pin.json).

## Frozen layout and restricted extraction

The extractor reads Python AST without executing the runner. The contract
fixes `Bool` order to `false, true`, `A[outcome][state]`, and
`B[next][previous][policy]`. `C`, `D`, and `E` index outcomes, states, and
policies respectively. The Boolean shapes are explicitly supplied/defaulted
as `2×2`, `2×2×2`, and length-two vectors; they are not inferred from runtime
`ModelParameters` behavior.

The accepted syntax has exactly one top-level, non-async `main` containing
one straight-line literal assignment to each table name. Numeric leaves
must be finite, non-Boolean constants whose exact decimal rational is dyadic.
Nested lists/tuples must be rectangular and match the declared shapes.
Exact arithmetic checks nonnegativity, each A outcome-column sum, each B
next-state-column sum, and each C/D/E vector sum against one. C normalization
is this finite model's convention, not a claim about arbitrary PyMDP utility
vectors.

Tests reject duplicate/reassigned tables, tracked-name shadowing, conditional
or nested assignments, method mutation, calls or computed expressions,
non-dyadic/nonfinite literals, and malformed shapes. This is a restricted
static acceptance contract, not complete Python dataflow analysis.

`generate_probe.py` emits the extracted tables as literal Boolean functions.
The symmetric Lean reference is the accepted Q2 payload; the asymmetric Lean
reference is a static, independently authored record in the generation
source. The manifest's `expected_payload` field is an extracted table
summary, **not** that independent proof oracle.

## Axis-sensitive control

The asymmetric fixture uses the following B policy slices, with rows for
next state and columns for previous state:

```text
B(false) = [[1/4, 3/4], [3/4, 1/4]]
B(true)  = [[1/2, 1/8], [1/2, 7/8]]
```

Each of the five nonidentity permutations of the three B axes changes at
least one entry. The tests enumerate all five. Swapping previous-state and
policy axes preserves normalization, so a separate native negative test
requires the generated proof against the unchanged independent payload to
fail. That native rejection test passed; exact results are recorded in the delivery report.

## Reproduction and retained checks

Run from the `fep_lean` repository root. Set `GNN_ROOT` to the actual GNN
checkout. An existing current source pin and finite input are prerequisites;
these commands do not silently re-pin or reinterpret stale inputs.

```bash
GNN_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/GeneralizedNotationNotation

uv run python specs/gnn-bridge-q5-artifact-proof/refresh_render.py \
  --gnn-root "$GNN_ROOT"
uv run python specs/gnn-bridge-q5-artifact-proof/generate_probe.py
uv run python specs/gnn-bridge-q5-artifact-proof/verify_native.py \
  --compile --gnn-root "$GNN_ROOT" \
  --receipt specs/gnn-bridge-q5-artifact-proof/native_receipt.json
```

`refresh_render.py` explicitly invokes the current GNN extractor
`extract_pomdp_from_file(strict_validation=True)`, then
`POMDPRenderProcessor._pomdp_to_gnn_spec`, then `render_gnn_spec`, in an
offline/no-sync GNN `uv` subprocess. It retains the emitted symmetric runner
and source provenance. This executes the renderer, not the generated runner.
A fresh render can change timestamp-bearing output bytes, invalidating old
probe and native receipts; regenerate and compile in that order.

`verify_native.py --compile` first builds the two imported Q2/Q4 targets,
then compiles each exact probe with six intended `#print axioms` requests
across the pair. Process-group-safe native calls are serialized. Successful
exit, no warnings or `sorry`, and complete parsed reports using only
`propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound` are required.

For subsequent read-only checks:

```bash
uv run python specs/gnn-bridge-q5-artifact-proof/generate_probe.py --check
uv run python specs/gnn-bridge-q5-artifact-proof/verify_native.py \
  --check --gnn-root "$GNN_ROOT" \
  --receipt specs/gnn-bridge-q5-artifact-proof/native_receipt.json
```

The native CLI defaults to `--check` when neither mode is supplied. It
reparses retained transcripts, recomputes verdicts, and checks current source,
render provenance, fixtures, expected-payload manifest, generator, extractor,
probes, toolchain binaries, and recursive local compiled imports. It neither
launches Lean nor writes artifacts. The exact generator buffer is checked
against the retained digest before that same buffer is executed for in-memory
regeneration, including both validation snapshots. A stale numerical receipt
cannot supply missing native or renderer evidence. Receipts remain local
execution records, not cryptographically signed attestations.

## Tests and related audit

[Static artifact tests](../../tests/test_gnn_artifact_proof.py) cover the
restricted extractor, exact generation, all B-axis permutations, and native
positive/negative probes. [Receipt tests](../../tests/test_gnn_artifact_receipt.py)
cover tampering, stale owners, missing native evidence, read-only behavior,
output collisions, and generator-read races. Receipt tests use synthetic
transcripts and are not themselves native execution evidence.

The separate [H2.7 audit](../horizon-2-smooth-stochastic/readiness/07-terminal-audit-20260904.md)
records its terminal/custody work and scientific limitations. Q5 does not
accept the wider H2 horizon; overall H2 acceptance remains open and H3 closed.
