# Discussion: Ecosystem Maturity and Formalization Impacts {#sec:discussion}

The central finding is not a binary judgment that Mathlib either does or does not support the FEP. Support is layered. At the pinned revision, the library supports direct native implementations of posterior kernels, KL divergence, Gaussian laws, conditional independence, Markov-kernel invariance, differentiation, finite information geometry, and convergence arguments. Project-authored definitions and composition theorems turn those primitives into {{semantic_dispositions.formalized}} directly formalized topic scopes. The package now includes one exact finite-state continuous-time chain; general continuous-state stochastic dynamics and system-level FEP claims still require new domain interfaces.

## Maturity Assessment of the Mathlib Ecosystem {#sec:maturity_assessment_of_the_mathlib_ecosystem}

Two maturity axes must remain separate. `mathlib_status` records whether a catalogue body targets available pinned infrastructure. Semantic disposition records whether its primary theorem matches the reviewed topic claim. All {{total_topics}} rows currently have `mathlib_status: real`, while {{semantic_dispositions.formalized}} are classified as directly formalized and the remainder retain explicit conditional or structural scopes. The fep-036 topic uses Mathlib's finite binomial PMF and sequence-limit APIs to prove an outcome-indexed Laplace prior, exact shrinkage, consistency transfer, and normalized posterior closure. The convergence module generates the empirical-frequency premise and whole-law limits; the learning module separately proves sub-Gaussian and finite-alphabet concentration, PAC-Bayes, posterior-gap, regret, and Bayes-factor laws; and fep-121--127 prove finite-law squared/Brier-risk and bad-event transfer for the same estimator. Posterior contraction, minimax or empirical-calibration guarantees, and a marginal-likelihood optimum remain absent.

### Coverage by Area {#sec:coverage_by_area}

The generated coverage report computes area counts, semantic disposition totals, declarations, imports, capability states, and authored relation witnesses from canonical sources. It should be consulted instead of a hand-maintained roster. Shared library coverage is strongest for finite sums, real analysis, measures, probability kernels, logarithms, exponentials, differentiation, matrices, and strong laws. The project now exercises all of these surfaces directly. Coverage remains narrower for smooth statistical manifolds, continuous stochastic processes, and generic blanket-existence claims.

### Module-Level Maturity and Compilation Outcomes {#sec:module_level_maturity}

The module-to-topic incidence table in `docs/formalism-coverage.md` is derived from actual `import` commands. An import is evidence that a topic uses a library surface; it is not evidence that two topics depend logically on each other, nor that a named scientific construct has been formalized. Compilation outcomes come only from the selected receipt (`{{verify.evidence_kind}}`, rate `{{compile_rate.total}}`).

### The Mathlib Frontier for Deeper Formalization {#sec:mathlib_frontier_20_percent}

The pinned Mathlib revision already provides `InformationTheory.klDiv` in `ℝ≥0∞`, self-divergence, zero characterization for finite measures, Gibbs' inequality, composition-product chain rules, native posterior kernels, and a real strong law. Rows fep-002, fep-014, fep-017, fep-034, and fep-041 use those measure APIs directly, while the maintained finite kernel supplies a real KL carrier, posterior VFE, mutual-information EFE decomposition, and exact policy model. The frontier is therefore no longer “define KL, Bayes, or EFE somehow”; it is comparison across alternative EFE conventions, data processing at the pin, and measure-valued identities under explicit finiteness and absolute-continuity conditions.

### Identified Mathlib Gaps {#sec:identified_mathlib_gaps}

The remaining high-leverage obligations are:

1. **Stronger empirical-Bayes statistical guarantees.** The finite strong-law layer supplies almost-sure atomwise, whole-law, and finite-observable expectation consistency; the learning layer supplies scoped concentration and model-evidence bounds; and the risk family supplies finite-law Laplace squared/Brier-risk transfer. Posterior contraction, minimax or empirical-calibration guarantees, and a named empirical marginal-likelihood optimum remain distinct extensions.
2. **Measure-valued conditional information and EFE comparison.** The finite carrier proves mutual-information and risk--ambiguity decompositions. Native random-variable or kernel statements are still needed to compare broader EFE formulations and continuous models.
3. **Continuous-state stochastic dynamics.** Langevin, Itô, Fokker--Planck, invariant-measure, and continuous path-space results require substantially more structure than the exact discrete semigroups, finite path laws, two-state continuous-time chain, and descent systems now present.
4. **Smooth statistical-manifold geometry.** The finite score carrier has matrix-valued metrics, categorical tangent positivity, pullbacks, scalar Cramér--Rao, invertible-chart natural gradients, mirror/Bregman identities, and replicator equivalence; the finite scalar exponential family adds log-partition differentiation, Fisher--variance, KL--Bregman, and local mean-coordinate duality. Multidimensional smooth atlases, dual connections, curvature, geodesics, and general optimizer convergence remain to be developed.
5. **Generic dynamical Markov blankets.** A concrete finite joint and typed transition now exist, and the weighted-Dirac embedding proves one native measure-theoretic `CondIndepFun` bridge plus rowwise closure. An invariant blanket predicate, closure under arbitrary current-state mixtures, and a blanket-existence theorem remain open.

Most are project-level model and theorem choices rather than confirmed Mathlib absences. The capability graph distinguishes a blocked project obligation from an upstream-library gap so responsibility is not displaced automatically onto Mathlib.

### A 6–12 Month Maturity Roadmap {#sec:maturity_roadmap}

The heading is retained for continuity, but the roadmap is dependency-ordered rather than calendar-promised:

1. connect the finite Laplace risk-transfer and learning-family concentration results to posterior contraction, minimax or empirical calibration, or a named empirical marginal-likelihood theorem on one sampling model;
2. add probability laws or learning over the finite policy-tree carrier, compare alternative EFE formulations there, and then lift successful equivalences to native measure-valued conditional information;
3. extend the concrete native blanket transfer to an invariant predicate, arbitrary-mixture closure, and one blanket-existence theorem for a specified dynamics;
4. generalize the exact two-state continuous-time chain to a finite CTMC construction, then choose one continuous-state diffusion, state existence and regularity assumptions, and prove its invariant law before attempting continuous path measures or Fokker--Planck equations;
5. lift the finite scalar exponential family to a multidimensional smooth family with dual connections, curvature, and coordinate-change theorems;
6. lift finite stick conservation and finite NESS currents to countable/probabilistic limit theorems only after their convergence contracts are explicit.

A row changes semantic disposition only after exact theorem review, native acceptance, assumption analysis, and a non-vacuity check. A new Mathlib release alone is not a promotion event.

### Comparison to Other Mathlib4 Formalization Projects {#sec:comparison_other_formalisation_projects}

Large Lean projects demonstrate that difficult mathematics can be organized into reviewable, kernel-checked libraries [@pfr2023lean; @scholze2022liquid]. The present catalogue is smaller and has a different purpose: it maps a heterogeneous scientific theory into explicit proof obligations and records semantic distance. It should not be compared by theorem count or compilation rate alone; the relevant measure is whether each mechanized statement captures the intended scientific claim under defensible assumptions.
