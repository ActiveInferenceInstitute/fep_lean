## Lean 4: A Primer for Active Inference Researchers {#sec:lean_4_a_primer_for_active_inference_researchers}

### Why Formal Verification Matters for the FEP {#sec:why_formal_verification_matters_for_the_fep}

The Free Energy Principle [@friston2010free; @parr2022active] rests on deep intersections of measure theory, stochastic calculus, differential geometry, and information theory. Informal mathematical proofs in this space — written in natural language with $\forall$ and $\exists$ symbols — are powerful but can harbor subtle errors: interchanging limits and expectations without justification, conflating almost-sure and sure convergence, or silently assuming absolute continuity of measures. When the FEP community claims that "variational free energy upper-bounds surprise," every step of the derivation must be airtight — yet in practice verification depends on peer review by a small number of domain experts.

**Lean 4** is an interactive theorem prover (ITP) that eliminates this bottleneck. Every inference step is machine-checked against foundational axioms. A theorem proven in Lean produces a *proof object* — a computational certificate that any independent verifier can validate in milliseconds. If Lean accepts a proof, the mathematical claim is correct *by construction*, modulo the foundational axioms of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions.

For Active Inference, this yields:

- **Verifiable variational bounds.** The claim $F \geq -\log p(s|m)$ is checked all the way down to the axiom level.
- **Dimension safety.** Type-checking prevents integrating over the wrong measure space or mixing distributions over incompatible state spaces.
- **Compositional scaling.** Proven lemmas compose into larger theorems without re-verification.
- **Reproducibility.** A Lean proof file is itself a reproducible artifact, unlike a journal PDF.

Throughout this primer — and the full {{total_topics}}-topic catalogue — the pinned toolchain is **Lean 4 `{{lean_toolchain}}`** with **Mathlib4 `{{mathlib_tag}}`**. Every lemma name, module path, and tactic behavior cited resolves against that exact pin; version drift is prevented by the `lean/lean-toolchain` and `lean/lakefile.lean` files in the repository.

### Propositions as Types: The Curry-Howard Correspondence {#sec:propositions_as_types_the_curry_howard_correspondence}

Lean 4 is built on a deep correspondence between logic and computation called the **Curry-Howard isomorphism**. The slogan — **propositions as types, proofs as programs** — captures the whole design: every mathematical proposition is reified as a type, every proof of that proposition is reified as a term (a program) inhabiting that type, and the compiler's type-checker *is* the proof-checker. Verifying "theorem $T$ is correct" reduces mechanically to verifying "the program `t` has type `T`".

| Logic | Type Theory (Lean 4) |
|-------|---------------------|
| Proposition $P$ | Type `P` |
| Proof of $P$ | Term `p : P` (a program of type `P`) |
| $P \implies Q$ | Function type `P → Q` (a program that transforms proofs) |
| $\forall x, P(x)$ | Dependent function `(x : α) → P x` |
| $P \land Q$ | Product type `P × Q` |
| $P \lor Q$ | Disjunction `Or P Q` (proof-irrelevant; `P ⊕ Q` is the data-level analogue) |
| Modus ponens | Function application `f a : Q` given `f : P → Q`, `a : P` |
| $\bot$ (false) | Empty type `False` |

In Lean 4, proving a theorem is equivalent to constructing a program whose type is the proposition being proved. If the program type-checks, the theorem is proven. This is fundamentally different from computer algebra systems (Mathematica, SymPy) which *compute* with symbols but cannot *prove* that a result holds for all inputs universally. The Curry-Howard lens is also what justifies the FEP verifier treating `lake env lean` exit code 0 as *proof*: successful type-checking of the proof term is, by construction, a checked proof of the stated theorem.

### Universe Polymorphism and Dependent Types {#sec:universe_polymorphism_and_dependent_types}

Standard type systems distinguish `Int`, `Float`, `String`. Lean 4 supports **dependent types** where types can depend on *values*:

```lean
-- A vector of exactly n elements
def Vector (α : Type) (n : Nat) : Type := ...

-- A probability measure on a measurable space
structure ProbMeasure (α : Type) [MeasurableSpace α] where
  μ : Measure α
  total : μ Set.univ = 1
```

For Active Inference, dependent types naturally encode:

- **Parameterized distributions.** `Distrib (S ω)` — distributions indexed by world-states.
- **Transition kernels.** `(s : State) → Measure (Action s)` — action distributions whose type depends on the current state.
- **Finite policy spaces.** `Fin n → Action` — a policy over exactly $n$ time steps.

Lean also leans heavily on **universe polymorphism** (`Type u`, `Type v`). In measure theory this prevents Russell's paradox by ensuring that the collection of all measurable spaces lives strictly above any individual space. FEP researchers encounter this most often as `{α : Type*}` in theorem signatures; the `*` simply means the type can live in any universe.

### Tactics: How Proofs Are Constructed {#sec:tactics_how_proofs_are_constructed}

Lean 4 proofs are written using **tactics**—commands that transform proof goals step by step. Key tactics used in FEP formalizations:

| Tactic | What it does | FEP usage |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `exact h` | Close goal exactly with term `h` | Apply `measure_union_le`, `measure_mono` directly |
| `rw [h]` | Rewrite goal using equation `h` | Substitute `IsProbabilityMeasure.measure_univ` |
| `apply f` | Apply function/lemma `f`, leaving subgoals | Apply `Real.exp_le_exp.mpr` for Gibbs monotonicity |
| `simp [h]` | Simplify using `h` and simp lemmas | Reduce `Finset.sum_div`, `Finset.card_range` |
| `intro x` | Introduce $\forall$/implication hypothesis into context | Start proofs of `∀ x, P x` or `P → Q` goals |
| `constructor` | Split a goal into its structural pieces | Build `And`/`Iff`/structure goals (e.g., softmax normalization $\land$ non-negativity) |
| `linarith` | Linear arithmetic over ordered fields | Derive bounds from KL ≥ 0 by rearranging |
| `nlinarith [h₁, h₂]` | Nonlinear arithmetic with hints | Prove quadratic contraction in gradient flow |
| `positivity` | Prove `0 ≤ e` or `0 < e` automatically | Non-negativity of sum of squares, `Real.sqrt` |
| `ring` | Prove equalities in commutative rings | Algebraic identities in free energy decompositions |
| `norm_num` | Evaluate numeric expressions | Verify `(2 : ℝ) > 0` or specific constants |
| `have h : P := ...` | Introduce intermediate lemma `h : P` | Build step-by-step proofs for complex bounds |
| `calc` | Chain transitivity steps | $a \leq b \leq c$ derivations in energy bounds |
| `sorry` | Admit goal without proof | Mark aspirational proof steps (compile flag) |

The catalogue's {{total_topics}} Lean bodies collectively exercise the major tactic families enumerated above. `exact`, `simp`, `rw`, `linarith`, `positivity`, and `have` dominate by frequency, while `nlinarith`, `ring`, `norm_num`, `intro`, `constructor`, and `calc` appear in specific topic families — for example, `calc` anchors fep-021's energy-bound derivation, and `constructor` structures fep-028's softmax lemma. The exhaustiveness claim is intentionally conservative: a small handful of niche tactics (e.g. `omega` and `decide`) are used opportunistically rather than uniformly.

**How `lake env lean` verification works in the pipeline.**

`LeanVerifier` writes each sketch to a temporary file under `lean/FepSketches/`. Before the subprocess call, `_wrap_lean_code` prepends `import Mathlib`, adds the standard `open MeasureTheory` line plus any area-specific opens, and wraps the body in a `namespace FEP<NNN> … end FEP<NNN>` block, where `<NNN>` is the topic's three-digit identifier. It then invokes:

```bash
lake env lean lean/FepSketches/FepCheck_fep001.lean
```

This executes inside the Lake build environment rooted at `lean/`, which provides access to the pre-compiled Mathlib4 `{{mathlib_tag}}` `.olean` files. Exit code 0 signals compilation success. The verifier captures `stdout` and `stderr`, sets `compiles` to `True` or `False`, detects a `sorry` tactic in the source text, and records the resulting `VerifyResult` in SQLite. With a warm Mathlib4 cache, each verification takes about 1–2 seconds.

> **Namespace isolation.** The `namespace FEP<NNN> ... end FEP<NNN>` wrapper prevents theorem-name collisions during the {{total_topics}}-topic aggregate compilation: when sketches are concatenated into `fep_all.lean` for the batch build, identically named helpers (for example two topics both declaring `aux_lemma`) live in disjoint namespaces and never clash. Every row in `config/topics.yaml` follows this pattern.

**Mathlib4 module map for FEP topics:**

| Topic Area | Key Mathlib4 Modules |
|-----------|---------------------|
| FEP / measure theory | `MeasureTheory.Measure.MeasureSpace`, `MeasureTheory.Measure.NullMeasurable` |
| Probability | `Probability.Notation`, `MeasureTheory.Measure.ProbabilityMeasure` |
| Special functions | `Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Log.Basic`, `Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Exp` |
| Linear algebra | `LinearAlgebra.Matrix.Transpose`, `Analysis.InnerProductSpace.Basic` |
| Finite sums | `Algebra.BigOperators.Group.Finset`, `Data.Finset.Basic` |
| Metric spaces | `Topology.MetricSpace.Basic`, `Topology.MetricSpace.PseudoMetric` |
| Real arithmetic | `Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Pow.Real`, `Mathlib.Tactic` |

### From Informal Bound to Lean Statement: A Minimal Walk-Through {#sec:informal_to_formal_walkthrough}

Before the full ELBO, consider the simplest FEP-flavoured informal claim and its literal translation into Lean.

**Informal (textbook):**

> *Claim.* For any two events $A, B$ in the state space of an agent, the probability that the world is in $A \cup B$ is at most the sum of the individual probabilities: $\mu(A \cup B) \leq \mu(A) + \mu(B)$. *(This is the countable-subadditivity bound that underwrites the union step in most FEP surprise-minimization arguments.)*

**Formalization, step by step:**

1. *Name the space.* Informal "state space" becomes `{α : Type*} [MeasurableSpace α]` — a type equipped with a σ-algebra.
2. *Name the measure.* Informal "probability" becomes `(μ : Measure α)` — a Mathlib4 `Measure` over that space.
3. *Name the events.* Informal "events $A, B$" become `(s t : Set α)`.
4. *State the inequality.* `μ (s ∪ t) ≤ μ s + μ t`.
5. *Discharge the proof.* Invoke the Mathlib4 lemma `measure_union_le` via the `exact` tactic.

**Formal (Lean 4, Mathlib4 `{{mathlib_tag}}`, catalogue row fep-001):**

```lean
import Mathlib

open MeasureTheory

namespace FEP001

theorem fep001_union_bound {α : Type*} [MeasurableSpace α]
    (μ : Measure α) (s t : Set α) :
    μ (s ∪ t) ≤ μ s + μ t := by
  exact measure_union_le s t

end FEP001
```

This three-line proof is a real (sorry-free) catalogue row: every implicit assumption of the informal claim has been made explicit (the type, its σ-algebra, and the two sets), and the inequality is discharged by a single pre-verified Mathlib4 lemma. The `FEP001` namespace prevents name collisions in the {{total_topics}}-topic aggregate build, and `open MeasureTheory` brings `Measure` and `measure_union_le` into scope without fully-qualified names. This is the template every catalogue sketch follows.

### Concrete Example: Informal vs Formal ELBO {#sec:concrete_example_informal_vs_formal_elbo}

**Informal (journal paper)**:

> *Theorem*. The Evidence Lower Bound maximizes model evidence: $\log p(s) \geq -F[q, p]$.
> *Proof*. By definition, $F = \KL[q \| p(\psi|s)] - \log p(s)$. Since KL divergence is non-negative, the result follows immediately by rearranging terms. ∎

**Formal (Lean 4 with Mathlib4 `{{mathlib_tag}}`)**:

```lean
import Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Measure.MeasureSpace
import Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Log.Basic

theorem elbo_bound {α : Type*} [MeasurableSpace α]
    (q p_prior p_likelihood : Measure α)
    [q.IsFiniteMeasure] [p_posterior.IsFiniteMeasure]
    (habs : q ≪ p_posterior) :
    Real.log (marginal_likelihood p_prior p_likelihood) ≥
      -variational_free_energy q p_prior p_likelihood := by
  -- 1. Unfold definitions
  unfold variational_free_energy
  unfold marginal_likelihood
  -- 2. Apply KL non-negativity
  have h_kl : klDiv q p_posterior ≥ 0 := measure_theory.klDiv_nonneg habs
  -- 3. Rearrange via linear arithmetic
  linarith [h_kl]
```

The formal version forces the researcher to confront every implicit assumption: Which spaces are we working over (`Type*`)? Are those spaces measurable (`[MeasurableSpace α]`)? Are the measures finite (`IsFiniteMeasure`)? Is the variational distribution absolutely continuous with respect to the true posterior (`q ≪ p_posterior`)?

**Catalogue note.** The illustrative blocks above may use explicit `import` lines for pedagogy. The {{total_topics}} committed topic bodies in `scripts/catalogue_sketches.py` (`SKETCHES`) carry their own targeted `import Mathlib.…` lines (typically one to four per topic); [`LeanVerifier._wrap_lean_code`](../src/verification/lean_verifier.py) treats a leading `import` as a signal to pass the body through unchanged rather than prepending the shared preamble (§\ref{sec:native_lean_4_compilation_and_zero_direct_verification}; Appendix B).

### Reading Type Error Messages {#sec:reading_type_error_messages}

When translating FEP physics into Lean, compilation errors typically fall into three categories:

1. **Type mismatch.** `application type mismatch: expected 'Measure ℝ', got 'ℝ'` — raised when passing a scalar prediction error into a function expecting a full belief distribution.
2. **Missing instance.** `failed to synthesize instance 'MeasurableSpace α'` — Lean refuses to integrate over a space that has not been declared measurable.
3. **Unsolved goal.** `unsolved goals: ⊢ q ≪ p` — the theorem requires absolute continuity, but no proof or hypothesis supplies it.

`LeanVerifier.classify_failure_kind` maps these patterns (plus `missing_import`, `renamed_identifier`, and `timeout`) onto the `FailureKind` enum carried inside every `VerifyResult`. These errors are not bugs in the pipeline; they are the compiler enforcing mathematical rigor.
