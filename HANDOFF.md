# fep_lean formalism and publication handoff

**Date:** 2026-08-24
**Repository:** `ActiveInferenceInstitute/fep_lean`
**Checkout:** this repository checkout (see the `origin` remote)
**Release line:** `v1.1.0`

## Mission and evidence boundary

This standalone repository now has an installable `fep_lean` package, a typed
155-topic semantic catalogue in 20 families, a pinned Lean kernel with warning
rejection, an authored formalism relation/capability graph, fail-closed evidence
receipts, and source-to-build manuscript rendering. Keep four claims separate:

1. catalogue generation is deterministic but verifies zero topics;
2. native Lean evidence proves that the exact selected source compiled at the
   pin without warnings or `sorry`;
3. semantic disposition records how closely a row matches its advertised
   scientific topic;
4. bounded Hermes/OpenGauss evidence applies only to the exact source and
   receipt schema it records; publication-grade live evidence requires a
   claim-ready report bound to the final source.

Two bounded one-topic OpenRouter/Hermes smokes were completed on 2026-08-20
against earlier source snapshots: `fep-001` with Kimi K2.6 and `fep-002` with
Gemini 3.7 Flash. Both selected topics passed the then-current pipeline, Gauss
session, and Lean checks. They are historical connectivity and workflow
evidence only: the source and receipt schema subsequently changed, and the
current validator correctly rejects both report directories as non-current.
The retained report directories are
`output/reports/run_20260820_150225_893319` and
`output/reports/run_20260820_150523_744462`.

The later 50-topic report,
`output/reports/run_20260820_183143_709998`, superseded those one-topic smokes
for its own source snapshot. It is now historical too: the schema-2 expansion
changed the roster, body-source manifest, formal resources, and source digests.
It must not be described as current evidence for the 155-topic checkout.

No provider secret is stored in the repository. Versioned publication does not
promote the historical provider runs: only a separately authorized,
source-bound full receipt can make a current Hermes/OpenGauss claim.

Never hand-edit `config/topics.yaml`, `src/fep_lean/data/topics.yaml`,
`lean/FepSketches/fep_all.lean`, any manifested `lean/FepSketches` formal resource,
`docs/formalism-coverage.*`, `docs/formalism-atlas.*`, or generated manuscript
output. Use the owner-provided generators and their `--check` modes.

## Current formal breadth and depth

- Stable schema-2 roster: `fep-001` through `fep-155`, partitioned into 20
  families across five areas.
- The generated coverage report owns all topic/formal-resource declaration,
  import, relation, and capability totals. Do not copy those moving totals into
  this handoff.
- Semantic review contains direct formalizations together with explicit
  conditional and structural proxies. Their assumptions and non-vacuity
  boundaries remain first-class even when the bodies compile.
- Manifested foundations and leaf compositions cover finite and
  measure-theoretic probability, Bayesian inversion, variational duality,
  active inference and controlled planning, temporal inference, causal
  interventions, predictive coding, stochastic thermodynamics, geometric
  optimization, collective inference, learning/model evidence, finite-sample
  risk, policy trees, native blanket transfer, exponential-family duality, and
  exact two-state continuous time.
- `fep-036` now defines a finite binomial sampling law and outcome-indexed
  Laplace prior, proves interiority, monotonicity, exact shrinkage, and
  consistency transfer from a convergent empirical frequency, while the
  statistical-convergence foundation derives the corresponding almost-sure
  Boolean, finite-atom, simultaneous, whole-law `L¹`, and finite-observable
  expectation limits. The `fep-121`--`fep-127` family now adds finite-law
  Laplace squared-risk and Brier-risk transfer plus event containment. It still
  does not claim posterior contraction, minimax optimality, empirical calibration, or a
  marginal-likelihood optimum.
- The formalism audit is designed to resolve every primary, relation,
  capability, and manifested formal-resource declaration, reject warnings and
  `sorryAx`, and require one parsed axiom result per declaration before
  recording the standard dependencies reported by Lean.

Compilation is not a proof of the FEP as a physical theory. Read
`docs/formalism-coverage.md` and `docs/theorem-maturity-audit.md` before
summarizing scientific completeness.

## Current source and evidence state

The 155-topic release recorded native, declaration/axiom, Python, browser, and
publication receipts for its exact source snapshot. The accepted post-v1.1.0
Horizon 1/Horizon 2 source wave and publication-owner change have invalidated
those receipts' current-source binding. They remain historical evidence and
must not be summarized as validation of the working tree.

H1.0--H1.8 are accepted, including the optional H1.5 lane. The archived
[Horizon 1 acceptance record](specs/done/horizon-1-finite-synthesis/README.md)
owns the implementation and review evidence. Its terminal theorem repairs the
first recorded H1.8 carrier-merge no-go with one finite, synthetic, one-step
posterior--decision--action certificate on a shared 16-state Boolean carrier.
The posterior update, emitted action, selected sampled kernel, genuine
sensory--active blanket factorization, and strict real/native KL decrease use
that same carrier and kernel. This is not transition-aware planning,
EFE-optimal control, physical thermodynamics, causal identification, empirical
validation, or a universal FEP theorem.

The active [Horizon 2 spec](specs/horizon-2-smooth-stochastic/README.md) has
separately accepted H2.0--H2.3b, H2.4a/b, H2.5a/b/c/d, H2.5b-R0,
H2.5d-R0, H2.6a/b/c, and H2.6a-R0. The maintained surface now includes scalar
Gaussian/native-KL and coordinate owners, a same-joint native posterior
martingale and limiting-observation endpoint, selected-model identification,
joint-law and fixed-truth consistency, weak Dirac and bounded-risk
consequences, the native semigroup/H1 lift, exact scalar and finite-axis
symmetric-precision transition families, the
exact four-axis specialization, an evidence-a.e. native scalar filter with
chronological finite recursion, one-step transition-consuming quadratic
decision risk, and monotone finite-grid path laws with coordinate reversal
plus explicit absolute-continuity/integrability failure boundaries. The
accepted generic H2.5b-R0 transition-covariance and H2.6a-R0 native-posterior
repairs remain append-only evidence alongside their accepted maintained owners.
The accepted H2.5d-R0 repair proves the centered native stationary-joint
factorization. Maintained H2.5d now proves the arbitrary-center native joint,
blanket-a.e. pair/scalar Gaussian conditionals, endpoint `CondIndepFun`, actual
stationary covariance `1 / 24`, and a bounded bivariate precision perturbation
with actual covariance `-1 / 15` and native non-independence. H2.7-R0 has
accepted the density-relative VFE and local natural-gradient bridge. H2.7 is
the sole legal implementation slice; H3 remains closed.

The canonical backlog row [`FEP-EVIDENCE-CURRENT`](TODO.md) owns the next
coordinated projection and receipt refresh against the final current accepted
owner roster. Until every validator is green against that roster, keep native,
declaration, Python, browser, numerical, manuscript, and provider evidence
planes separate.
The 2026-08-20 Hermes/OpenGauss report likewise remains historical for its
exact 50-topic source digest; current provider claims require a new,
independently validated source-bound full report.

The canonical Python-acceptance command runs the exact collected suite and
atomically writes `output/pytest.xml`, `output/coverage.xml`, and
`output/python-acceptance.json`; a raw `pytest` run is a useful development
gate but is not a release receipt. Catalogue/manuscript generation precedes
that receipt because `manuscript/manuscript_vars.yaml` owns the canonical test
count. Browser capture follows the final renderer sources and atlas/dashboard
bytes. The two archive builds must remain byte-identical and independently
validate against the live checkout before publication.

Independently validate the native receipt against the live source tree before
using its prose projection. The CI workflow contains the exact validation
snippet.

## Historical external stage

`FEP-FULL-002` and `FEP-PROV-003` were closed for the earlier 50-topic snapshot
by its full report and artifact validation. That dated task closure is not a
current 155-topic acceptance receipt. The two earlier one-topic smokes remain
historical as well.

Never print, persist, or infer credentials from a successful run. A retained
receipt supports only the exact source digest and roster it records; it does not
authorize publication or establish the FEP as a physical theory.

## Next-review protocol

1. Read the nearest `AGENTS.md`, inspect `git status --short --branch`, and
   preserve unrelated or concurrent changes.
2. Edit maintained owners only; regenerate and inspect every projection.
3. Treat semantic-disposition changes as mathematical review, not as an
   automatic consequence of compilation.
4. Run impact analysis if GitNexus becomes available. It was unavailable for
   this nested checkout, so this pass used direct import/declaration searches,
   consumer tests, and native builds with reduced graph confidence.
5. Before any separately authorized publication, inspect the exact diff, run
   all applicable gates, commit intentionally, push, and verify remote parity.
