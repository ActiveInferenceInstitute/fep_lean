# fep_lean

`fep_lean` is a standalone catalogue of 155 Free Energy Principle, Active
Inference, Bayesian Mechanics, Information Geometry, and Thermodynamics topics.
Each row contains a reviewed invariant, explicit assumptions, a Lean 4 theorem
body, and typeset signatures. The pinned Lean workspace is the compilation
authority; the semantic review separately records how far each theorem reaches
toward its topic label. The schema-2 roster spans 20 reviewed families in five
areas and is a versioned interface, not an exhaustive census of the FEP
literature. The twenty families include five second-expansion families for
finite-sample risk, closed-loop policy trees, native blanket transfer, finite
exponential-family dual geometry, and exact two-state continuous time.

## Release

Version `1.1.0` is the 155-topic publication cut. The canonical software
release is [GitHub `v1.1.0`](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/fep_lean/releases/tag/v1.1.0),
and the evolving scholarly record is identified by the
[Zenodo concept DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19699233). The GitHub
release notes cross-reference the immutable Zenodo version DOI and publish the
release-bundle checksum; the bundle manifest remains the owner of per-file
hashes. Neither publication surface changes the evidence boundaries below.

## Contract

`full` execution is strict. It requires the pinned Lean/Lake/Mathlib workspace,
the `gauss` executable, configured Hermes credentials, and writable SQLite
state. Every selected row must compile without `sorry` or Lean warnings, and a
requested review workflow must complete its post-compile review turn.
**Missing capability or incomplete stage → `complete: false`, no report
directory.**

`catalogue` execution is deterministic and offline. It validates the complete
YAML source and writes figures, manuscript variables, the unified appendix, and
a report explicitly marked `catalogue`; it does not count topics as verified.

`verify` execution is Lean-only. It runs the sealed-roster native compile sweep
without Hermes or OpenGauss. Add `--receipt output/native-verification.json
--fail-on-warnings` to persist independently revalidatable native evidence.

`atlas` execution is deterministic and offline. It projects the canonical
coverage join into a standalone SVG and an interactive, keyboard-accessible
HTML graph; `--check` fails on missing or stale bytes. The graph distinguishes
derivational formal edges from checked formal pairings that place two endpoint
laws side by side without asserting implication. Both name qualified Lean
witnesses; conceptual and blocker edges remain visibly non-proof evidence.

`dashboard` execution is also deterministic and offline. It renders static
and interactive numerical witnesses for all fifteen expansion families. The
first ten cover Bayesian inversion, variational duality, control, temporal
inference, causal intervention, predictive coding, path thermodynamics,
categorical Fisher geometry, consensus, and finite concentration; the latest
five cover Laplace/Brier risk transfer, policy-tree feedback, native blanket
conditional independence, exponential-family duality, and a two-state master
equation. These witnesses expose computational behavior and boundary cases but
never replace native Lean or axiom-audit evidence.

## Formal depth

The live formalism is organized into theorem-connected strands rather than a
headline theorem count: normalized finite probability and information
algebras, including support-free separation for the explicitly totalized finite
KL; posterior-form variational free energy and a uniquely attained evidence
lower bound; both expected-free-energy decompositions; a transition-consistent
infer--select--act joint and prior-sensitive Boolean policy witness;
stage-dependent cumulative finite-horizon EFE; finite Bayesian inversion,
variational duality, controlled and temporal inference, causal interventions,
and generalized predictive coding; path-space fluctuation identities and
reversible KL dissipation; categorical Fisher geometry, Cramér--Rao,
natural-gradient, mirror-descent, and replicator laws; collective inference;
finite concentration and model-evidence results; finite Laplace/Brier risk
transfer; observation-contingent policy-tree recursion and dominance; native
`CondIndepFun` blanket transfer; scalar exponential-family KL/Bregman duality;
and an exact two-state continuous-time semigroup, master equation, detailed
balance, relaxation, and Lyapunov law. The generated
[coverage report](docs/formalism-coverage.md) owns all current counts, and the
[atlas](docs/formalism-atlas.html) shows exactly which relations have Lean
witnesses. The semantic firewall requires every non-formalized row to expose
an explicit scope or assumption boundary. The reusable kernel is an explicit
manifest of foundations and leaf composition modules; `composed.lean` is only
their import aggregate. The maturity audit, rather than compilation alone,
records which rows are direct formalizations and which remain conditional or
structural proxies.

**Current evidence boundary.** The maintained catalogue spans 155 topics.
H1.0--H1.8 have exited through their accepted gates, with optional H1.5
accepted separately; the archived
[Horizon 1 record](specs/done/horizon-1-finite-synthesis/README.md) owns the
detailed evidence. Its terminal theorem is one finite, synthetic, one-step
posterior--decision--action certificate on a shared 16-state Boolean carrier.
The learned posterior, emitted action, sampled kernel, genuine sensory--active
blanket factorization, and strict real/native KL decrease remain connected on
that same carrier and kernel. The record also preserves the first H1.8
carrier-merge no-go. It does not establish transition-aware planning,
EFE-optimal control, physical or causal adequacy, empirical validation, or a
universal FEP claim.

The active [Horizon 2 spec](specs/horizon-2-smooth-stochastic/README.md) has
accepted H2.0--H2.3b, H2.4a/b, H2.5a/b/c/d, H2.5b-R0, H2.5d-R0,
H2.6a/b/c, and H2.6a-R0. The current smooth surface includes fixed-variance scalar Gaussian
KL/information geometry, local coordinate duality, a same-joint native
posterior martingale with its limiting-observation conditional-expectation
endpoint, selected-model identification, joint-law and fixed-truth posterior
consistency, weak convergence to the sampled-parameter Dirac law,
bounded-continuous transfer, bounded zero-one risk convergence, native
kernel/action semigroups, exact scalar and finite-axis linear-Gaussian
transition families, the exact four-axis symmetric-precision specialization,
an evidence-a.e. native Gaussian filter with chronological finite recursion,
one-step transition-consuming quadratic decision risk, and monotone finite-grid
path laws with explicit support and log-ratio boundaries. The accepted R0
repairs preserve the historical H2.0 no-go rows while their maintained owners
derive the replacement mathematics. H2.5d-R0 reconstructs the centered Fin4
stationary joint. Maintained H2.5d extends that native conditional product to
every stationary center, proves blanket-a.e. pair and scalar conditional laws
plus endpoint `CondIndepFun`, and derives a fixed bivariate precision
perturbation with actual covariance `-1 / 15` and native non-independence.
H2.7-R0 has accepted the continuous density-relative exact-posterior VFE and
derived local natural-gradient seam. H2.7 is now the sole legal implementation
slice. H3 remains closed until the connected H2.7 terminal merge and its
separate review gate pass.

That formal exit is not current publication evidence. The retained exact-roster
native, declaration/axiom, Python, and Chrome receipts validate the frozen
v1.1.0 release snapshot only; their former counts and hashes remain historical
until every live-source validator accepts a coordinated replacement.
[`TODO.md`](TODO.md) retains that refresh as `FEP-EVIDENCE-CURRENT`. The local
full-report
path `output/reports/run_20260820_183143_709998/` remains historical evidence
for the earlier 50-topic source snapshot and does not bind the 155-topic
source; ignored provider reports are deliberately not shipped in a release.
The earlier Kimi and Gemini one-topic runs are historical smoke evidence as
well. No provider secret is stored in the
repository, and no execution receipt authorizes publication or proves the FEP
as a physical theory.

## Quick start

Run operator commands from a source checkout. Installed wheels support the
packaged `FEPTopicCatalogue.default()` API and `fep-lean --help`; substantive
commands deliberately require the checkout-owned configuration, Lean
workspace, and manuscript assets. From another directory, pass
`--project-root /path/to/fep_lean` before the subcommand.

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run python docs/pin_audit.py --check-latest
uv run fep-lean catalogue
uv run fep-lean atlas
uv run fep-lean dashboard
uv run fep-lean setup
uv run fep-lean verify --fail-on-warnings \
  --receipt output/native-verification.json
uv run fep-lean preflight
uv run fep-lean run
```

Use `uv run fep-lean --help` for filters, workflow selection, and the explicit
checkout root. The equivalent maintained scripts are thin command wrappers in
[`scripts/`](scripts/).

## Source of truth

- [`config/catalogue_metadata.yaml`](config/catalogue_metadata.yaml) maintains
  the stable roster's descriptive and Mathlib metadata.
- [`config/theorem_maturity.yaml`](config/theorem_maturity.yaml) maintains the
  semantic review independently of syntactic compilation maturity.
- [`config/formalism_novelty.yaml`](config/formalism_novelty.yaml) records every
  post-baseline topic's nearest predecessors, invariant, carrier delta, and
  required composition theorem.
- [`config/formalism_relations.yaml`](config/formalism_relations.yaml) maintains
  reviewed formal, conceptual, and blocker relations plus retained open,
  partial, and satisfied capability history. Shared imports never create
  scientific-dependency edges.
- [`src/fep_lean/catalogue/bodies/`](src/fep_lean/catalogue/bodies/) contains
  the family-owned Lean bodies;
  [`registry.py`](src/fep_lean/catalogue/registry.py) validates their canonical
  order and [`latex.py`](src/fep_lean/catalogue/latex.py) derives theorem
  signatures.
- [`config/topics.yaml`](config/topics.yaml) and
  [`src/fep_lean/data/topics.yaml`](src/fep_lean/data/topics.yaml) are generated,
  byte-identical catalogue projections; regenerate them with
  [`scripts/_maint_build_topics_catalogue.py`](scripts/_maint_build_topics_catalogue.py).
- [`lean/FepSketches/fep_all.lean`](lean/FepSketches/fep_all.lean) is the tracked
  aggregate generated by
  [`scripts/_maint_build_fep_all_lean.py`](scripts/_maint_build_fep_all_lean.py).
- [`src/fep_lean/formal/manifest.py`](src/fep_lean/formal/manifest.py) owns the
  formal-resource roster. Canonical cross-topic proofs live in
  [`formal/compositions/`](src/fep_lean/formal/compositions/), while
  [`composed.lean`](src/fep_lean/formal/composed.lean) is the import-only
  aggregate; all tracked Lake projections are generated by
  [`scripts/_maint_build_formal_modules.py`](scripts/_maint_build_formal_modules.py).
- [`docs/formalism-coverage.md`](docs/formalism-coverage.md),
  [`docs/formalism-atlas.svg`](docs/formalism-atlas.svg), and
  [`docs/formalism-atlas.html`](docs/formalism-atlas.html) are generated views
  of the same canonical semantic graph.

## Review contracts

- [`ISA.md`](ISA.md) defines the ideal state, anti-criteria, and evidence gates.
- [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) is the canonical open-only backlog with behavior-based
  acceptance probes.
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) records release changes and their evidence
  boundary.
- [`manuscript/04i_formalism_catalogue_155.md`](manuscript/04i_formalism_catalogue_155.md)
  states the five new families, theorem assumptions, non-vacuity witnesses,
  and evidence boundaries in one authored chapter.
- [`HANDOFF.md`](HANDOFF.md) gives the next reviewer the operating protocol,
  evidence pointers, and extension backlog.

## Notation

Lean identifiers are deliberately topic-prefixed (`fepNNN_*`) and should be
read together with the corresponding invariant and `assumption_review` in
`config/theorem_maturity.yaml`. The generated appendix renders exact theorem
signatures; prose notation is never an alternative source for the Lean API.
