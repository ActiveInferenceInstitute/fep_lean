# AGENTS.md — fep_lean

## Purpose

Standalone 155-topic FEP / Active Inference / Bayesian Mechanics / Information
Geometry / Thermodynamics catalogue with Lean 4 source, Hermes integration,
OpenGauss SQLite persistence, deterministic manuscript artifacts, and strict
reports.

## Terminology

The Lean code for each catalogue row is a **canonical topic body**. Family-owned
modules under `src/fep_lean/catalogue/bodies/` export those bodies, and
`src/fep_lean/catalogue/registry.py` validates and merges them. The generated
runtime field remains named `lean_sketch` for API compatibility. The reviewed
invariant, formal Lean identifiers, and explicit assumptions define the row's
**theorem proxy** and scientific scope in `config/theorem_maturity.yaml`.
Compilation without `sorry` establishes that exact Lean body only; it does not
promote the semantic disposition or prove the full FEP concept.

## Source of truth

- `config/catalogue_metadata.yaml` — schema-2 roster seal, family membership,
  titles, areas, Mathlib hints, and compile-maturity metadata.
- `config/theorem_maturity.yaml` — maintained semantic review records for the
  catalogue theorem proxies; `docs/theorem-maturity-audit.md` is generated from
  this file.
- `config/formalism_novelty.yaml` — maintained expansion ledger with earlier
  nearest topics, invariants, carrier deltas, and required `FEPComposed`
  bridges.
- `config/formalism_relations.yaml` — maintained derivational-formal,
  theorem-pairing, conceptual, and blocker relations plus retained capability
  status/evidence. Never infer these from shared imports; both theorem-backed
  kinds require qualified Lean witnesses.
- `src/fep_lean/catalogue/bodies/*.py` — family-owned canonical Lean bodies.
- `src/fep_lean/catalogue/registry.py` and `latex.py` — validated body registry
  and deterministic theorem-signature projection.
- `config/topics.yaml` and `src/fep_lean/data/topics.yaml` — byte-identical,
  generated catalogue projections; never author either by hand.
- `scripts/_maint_build_topics_catalogue.py` — YAML regeneration.
- `scripts/_maint_build_fep_all_lean.py` — tracked aggregate regeneration.
- `src/fep_lean/formal/manifest.py` — explicit foundation, leaf-composition,
  and aggregate resource roster. Cross-topic proofs live in
  `formal/compositions/*.lean`; `formal/composed.lean` is the import-only
  aggregate. `scripts/_maint_build_formal_modules.py` projects the manifest
  into the workspace.
- `lean/FepSketches/fep_all.lean` — whole-catalogue Lean target.
- `ISA.md` — ideal-state criteria, anti-criteria, and evidence gates.
- `TODO.md` — canonical open-only backlog; completed work is not retained as
  struck-through rows.
- `HANDOFF.md` — next-reviewer protocol, evidence receipt, and remaining scope.

## Execution contract

- `uv run fep-lean catalogue` is explicit offline mode. It creates deterministic
  catalogue artifacts and reports zero verified topics.
- `uv run fep-lean verify` is the Lean-only native compile path. It requires
  the built pinned Mathlib cache but does not call Hermes, OpenGauss, or the
  full pipeline. Use `--receipt PATH --fail-on-warnings` for publication-grade
  native evidence.
- `uv run fep-lean atlas` projects the canonical coverage graph to offline SVG
  and accessible HTML; `--check` is a non-mutating freshness gate.
- `uv run fep-lean dashboard` evaluates the typed numerical witnesses and
  projects their shared model to offline SVG and accessible HTML; it is
  explanatory non-proof evidence, and `--check` is non-mutating.
- `uv run fep-lean run` is strict full mode. It requires configured Hermes,
  OpenGauss, Lean, Lake, and a complete pinned Mathlib build.
- Missing capabilities, failed topics, or artifact errors produce a failed
  result and no successful report.
- A full-mode report's `complete: true` means all *selected* topics passed (via
  `FEP_LEAN_MAX_TOPICS` or the default full catalogue). It is publication-ready
  only when `validate_report_receipt(...).claim_ready` independently validates
  the complete full-mode artifact set. Catalogue-mode completion is never
  Hermes or Lean evidence. A native receipt is separately claim-ready only for
  the live-source-bound sealed roster, actual compiler output matching the pin,
  the resolved Mathlib revision, and zero errors, warnings, or `sorry`.
- `run_validation_checks` is read-only. Dependency acquisition belongs only to
  `uv run fep-lean setup` and is bounded by `FEP_LEAN_SETUP_TIMEOUT_SEC`.
- `preflight` JSON output is advisory subject to additive field changes between
  releases. Stable referential queries use the CLI exit code and `status` field.

## Required checks

```bash
uv run python scripts/_maint_build_topics_catalogue.py --check
uv run python scripts/_maint_build_fep_all_lean.py --check
uv run python scripts/_maint_build_formal_modules.py --check
uv run python scripts/theorem_maturity_audit.py --check
uv run python scripts/build_formalism_coverage.py --check
uv run python scripts/_maint_build_lean_landscape.py --check
uv run fep-lean atlas --check
uv run fep-lean dashboard --check
uv run python scripts/audit_formalisms.py \
  --receipt output/formalism-audit.json
uv run python docs/theorem_ref_audit.py
uv run python docs/citation_audit.py
uv run python scripts/render_manuscript.py --check
uv run pytest tests/ -q --cov=src --cov-fail-under=89

uv run python docs/check_links.py --strict --include-root
uv run python docs/md_hygiene.py --strict
uv run python docs/pin_audit.py
uv run python docs/xref_audit.py
```

Do not claim Lean verification from catalogue mode or from generated manuscript
values. Native compilation and full Hermes/OpenGauss execution are distinct
evidence planes; state exactly which validated receipt supports a claim.
