# Native finite-grid paths for the scalar Gaussian semigroup

This composition builds only a finite discrete grid from the accepted scalar
OU transition.  Its comparison law is the forward law mapped through a
coordinate-reversal involution; it is not asserted to be an independently
constructed reverse dynamics.  Native KL statements retain absolute-
continuity and log-ratio integrability boundaries explicitly.
