# A shared finite active-inference model

One policy-conditioned carrier owns prediction, observation, posterior state,
preferences, expected free energy, policy selection, and action pushforward.
The epistemic sign is fixed by definition, while a theorem derives the
risk-plus-ambiguity decomposition under explicit full-support hypotheses.

/-! ## Exact two-state, two-observation witness

The following symmetric carrier makes the support, sign, and prior-sensitivity
contracts concrete.  Both policies share a fully supported transition and
likelihood, so their EFE values agree; changing only the normalized policy prior
therefore changes the posterior policy mass exactly rather than being erased by
the Boltzmann normalization.

/-! ## Bridge: pragmatic-epistemic decomposition matching the Python demonstration

The ActiveInferenceSynthetic Python code (``src/expected_free_energy.py`` and
``src/policy_planning.py``) defines the expected free energy of one action as

``G(a) = -(E[ln P(o|a)] + I(s; o|a))``.

The theorems below prove that the library's ``expectedFreeEnergy`` agrees with
this sign convention and that the decomposition ties directly to the finite-KL
nonnegativity and mutual-information identity already established.
