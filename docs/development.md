# Development guide

## Setup

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run python -c "from fep_lean.catalogue import FEPTopicCatalogue; print(len(FEPTopicCatalogue.default().topics))"
```

The distribution uses a single `fep_lean` namespace under `src/fep_lean/`.
Do not add `PYTHONPATH` shims or import obsolete top-level modules such as
`catalogue` or `pipeline`; the isolated-wheel test enforces this boundary.

## Canonical authoring graph

- `config/catalogue_metadata.yaml`: stable topic metadata and Mathlib hints.
- `config/theorem_maturity.yaml`: semantic review and primary theorem.
- `config/formalism_novelty.yaml`: expansion-row nearest topics, carrier delta,
  invariant, and required composition bridge.
- `config/formalism_relations.yaml`: explicit derivational formal,
  non-implicational formal-pairing, conceptual, and blocker relations plus
  retained capability status/evidence.
- `src/fep_lean/catalogue/bodies/*.py`: family-owned canonical Lean bodies;
  `registry.py` validates their sole ordered union and `latex.py` derives
  theorem signatures.
- `src/fep_lean/formal/`: reusable finite and measure-theoretic foundations plus
  exact cross-topic proofs; `manifest.py` owns foundation, leaf-composition,
  and aggregate roles.
- `config/topics.yaml`, packaged `src/fep_lean/data/topics.yaml`, aggregate
  Lean, maturity audit, and coverage files: generated projections.

Every body keeps its `namespace FEPNNN ... end FEPNNN` wrapper and may declare
the narrow Mathlib imports it needs. Generated aggregate wrappers add a second
topic namespace to prevent helper collisions.

## Change loop

```bash
uv run python scripts/_maint_build_topics_catalogue.py
uv run python scripts/_maint_build_fep_all_lean.py
uv run python scripts/_maint_build_formal_modules.py
uv run python scripts/theorem_maturity_audit.py
uv run python scripts/build_formalism_coverage.py
uv run fep-lean atlas
uv run fep-lean dashboard

uv run ruff check src tests scripts docs
uv run ruff format --check src tests scripts docs
uv run mypy src
uv run pytest tests/ -q --cov=src --cov-fail-under=89
uv run python docs/check_links.py --strict --include-root
uv run python docs/md_hygiene.py --strict
uv run python docs/pin_audit.py
uv run python docs/xref_audit.py
```

Run native Lean acceptance separately because it is the expensive semantic
compiler boundary:

```bash
uv run fep-lean verify \
  --fail-on-warnings \
  --receipt output/native-verification.json
cd lean && lake build FepSketches
cd .. && uv run python scripts/audit_formalisms.py \
  --receipt output/formalism-audit.json
```

The native receipt establishes exact-source compilation for the stable topic
roster; the formalism audit separately covers the maintained formal modules
and reviewed declarations. A credentialed full run remains a distinct gate:

```bash
uv run fep-lean preflight
uv run fep-lean run --topic fep-001
uv run fep-lean run
```

Never inject credentials into source, tests, or generated evidence.

## Package boundaries

| Area | Path | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Catalogue | `src/fep_lean/catalogue/` | typed authoring, loading, audits, coverage |
| Formal kernel | `src/fep_lean/formal/` | reusable finite carriers, cross-topic proofs, and exact Lake projection |
| Verification | `src/fep_lean/verification/` | read-only capability probes, Lean subprocesses, declaration/axiom audit |
| Hermes | `src/fep_lean/llm/` | provider request, retry, and response validation |
| Sessions | `src/fep_lean/gauss/` | SQLite ownership and per-topic runner |
| Pipeline | `src/fep_lean/pipeline/` | strict `catalogue`/`full` orchestration |
| Output | `src/fep_lean/output/` | receipts, reports, figures, rendering, atlas, and numerical witness dashboard |

Use type hints on public APIs, immutable dataclasses for source records,
structured results at subprocess/network boundaries, and temporary paths in
tests. Preserve catalogue, native, and full-run evidence as separate types and
claims.

For theorem ownership, support conventions, the validation ladder, and the
limits of numerical witnesses, see
[formal-kernel methods](formal-kernel-methods.md).

## Roster expansion

The current schema deliberately seals a reviewed, family-partitioned roster.
Adding another topic is a policy/schema change, not a YAML append. It requires
updating the roster seal and family metadata, semantic record, canonical body,
novelty record and composition bridge, generated projections, registry and
coverage tests, and manuscript review together. A new ID is not accepted until
that scientific review and its native acceptance plan are explicit.

[troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md).
