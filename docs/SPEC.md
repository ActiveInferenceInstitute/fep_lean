# Documentation specification

Documentation is self-contained within this checkout and must describe the
current `fep-lean` CLI and pipeline contract. Every relative link must resolve
from its owning Markdown file. Generated manuscript inputs are materialized by
`uv run fep-lean catalogue` before cross-reference validation.

Required documentation checks:

```bash
uv run python docs/check_links.py --strict --include-root
uv run python docs/md_hygiene.py --strict
uv run python docs/pin_audit.py
uv run python docs/xref_audit.py
uv run python docs/theorem_ref_audit.py
uv run python docs/citation_audit.py
uv run python scripts/build_formalism_coverage.py --check
uv run fep-lean atlas --check
uv run fep-lean dashboard --check
uv run python scripts/render_manuscript.py --check
```

Claims about catalogue compilation must be backed by a current validated
native receipt. Claims about maintained-module declarations and axioms must be
backed by the formalism audit. Claims about Hermes/OpenGauss execution must be
backed by an independently validated complete `full` result and its manifest.
Offline catalogue output must be labeled as catalogue data, and numerical
dashboard witnesses must never be described as proof evidence.

## Prospective design boundary

Files under [`docs/design/`](design/README.md) describe proposed research and
architecture. They may name target declarations and acceptance probes, but
they do not extend the current topic roster, maturity ledger, capability graph,
formal module manifest, or evidence receipts. A design goal becomes active only
through a bounded implementation spec under `specs/`; generated coverage must
never project unimplemented design objects.

Current-state documentation links to canonical source or generated evidence.
Design documentation links back to those owners and must not copy their live
counts, theorem rosters, or capability status as a second authority.
