verified**. This document is the design goal;
implementation status lives in the spec slices per the
[design lifecycle](../README.md). The active catalogue program lives in
[FEP research horizons](../fep-research-program/README.md); this program is an
independent articulation with the sibling repository
`GeneralizedNotationNotation` (GNN). No topics, formalism relations, atlas
edges, or `fep-NNN` identifiers are claimed or reserved; the registered
implementation artifacts are the Q1–Q4 foundation modules, Q5–Q7's slice-local
proof probes, and W2's `src/fep_lean/bridge/` operations, owned by their
spec slices.

## Why this program exists

GNN is a text-based notation for Active Inference generative models with a
25-step processing pipeline that validates, renders, and executes model
documents. fep_lean states and proves invariants about the same objects in
Lean 4. The released manuscript already names the gap:

> Executable Active-Inference tools and notations such as pymdp or GNN
> occupy a different layer. They specify and run model instances; Lean
> states and proves invariants. A useful bridge would translate a typed
> model representation into a common Lean probability/kernel structure,
> generate proof obligations for normalization and conditional independence,
> and retain a provenance link back to executable parameters.

(citation markers removed; `manuscript/05d_comparative_analysis.md:37`.) The
same chapter adds that a numerical implementation can be tested on data while
a theorem is checked for deductive correctness, and that "neither subsumes
the other" (`manuscript/05d_comparative_analysis.md:39`). This program keeps
both layers and makes their agreement checkable instead of asserted.

## Parties and authority

| Party | Role in the bridge |
| --- | --- |
| fep_lean | Lean 4 semantic authority: laws, kernels, blankets, free-energy and decision quantities, and their proofs; the pinned workspace is the compilation authority |
| GNN | Notation and tooling authority: GNN document syntax, the pipeline step registry, render targets, and execution semantics |
| Interchange artifact | GNN document files carrying mandatory provenance back to the Lean source |

## North star

```text
named Lean generative-model definition
  -> deterministic projection (variables, index types, dependencies, parameters)
  -> GNN document with provenance
  -> GNN validate / ontology / render / execute (steps 3, 5, 10, 11, 12)
  -> execution artifacts (render and execution summaries)
  -> certificate: execution-derived quantities vs Lean-witnessed properties
```

and the reverse direction:

```text
GNN syntax and step inventory (doc/gnn/gnn_syntax.md; src/pipeline/step_registry.py)
  -> Lean AST and decidable well-formedness
  -> static and dynamic semantics
  -> denotations reusing fep_lean carriers (FiniteLaw, FiniteKernel, FiniteHMM, LinearGaussianParameters)
  -> FEP instantiation and renderer-preservation statements
```

Every arrow must be deterministic and name its evidence plane. An arrow that
requires judgment calls is a finding to resolve, not a pipeline stage.

## The two directions

- [Direction 1 — render and execute Lean-expressed generative models](direction-1-lean-to-gnn.md):
  from a Lean expression of a generative model to a GNN document the GNN
  toolchain renders and executes, with certificates back to Lean.
- [Direction 2 — formalize GNN steps and methods](direction-2-gnn-to-lean.md):
  from the frozen GNN syntax surface and step registry to Lean ASTs, decidable
  well-formedness, dynamic semantics, and alignment theorems on fep_lean
  carriers.
- [Bridge contract](bridge-contract.md): the shared, mirrored agreement both
  sides edit and honor.

## Model-kind alignment

The bridge aligns the two supported model kinds on each side:

| GNN model kind | fep_lean counterpart |
| --- | --- |
| Discrete POMDP family: `A` likelihood, `B` transition ordered `(next_state, previous_state, action)`, `C` preferences, `D` initial prior, optional `E` habit, `F[1]` variational-free-energy readout | finite carrier family: `lean/FepSketches/active_inference.lean` (`GenerativeModel`), `lean/FepSketches/finite_probability.lean` (`FiniteLaw`, `FiniteKernel`), `lean/FepSketches/temporal_inference.lean` (`FiniteHMM`) |
| Continuous linear-Gaussian family: `F/H/Q/R` with `prior_mean`/`prior_cov`, `x_t = F x_{t-1} + u_{t-1} + N(0,Q)`, `y_t = H x_t + N(0,R)` | smooth/stochastic carrier family: `lean/FepSketches/linear_gaussian_semigroup.lean`, `lean/FepSketches/scalar_gaussian_semigroup.lean`, `lean/FepSketches/continuous_time_markov.lean` |

Blanket structure and the ontology bindings `s=HiddenState`, `o=Observation`,
`π=PolicyVector`, `u=Action` correspond to
`lean/FepSketches/markov_blanket.lean` and `lean/FepSketches/native_blanket.lean`.

## Decisions fixed by this design

1. **One interchange artifact.** GNN document files only. Any typed
   intermediate projection stays private to the emitter.
2. **Provenance is mandatory.** Every emitted document records source
   repository, commit digest, Lean module and definition, and generator
   identity in a provenance section.
3. **Deterministic projection or nothing.** No heuristic or model-based
   extraction sits inside the emitter; judgment belongs to the mapping
   review, not the pipeline.
4. **Evidence planes stay distinct.** Lean native compilation, semantic
   review, numerical witnesses, and GNN pipeline execution remain separate
   evidence classes. A GNN run never promotes a Lean claim, and a Lean claim
   never substitutes for an executed artifact.
5. **Two model kinds only.** Discrete/categorical and continuous
   linear-Gaussian. Anything else is out of scope until the contract is
   reopened.
6. **Misfit is reported, not repaired.** Where a projected model exceeds a
   backend, the GNN `unsupported` render status applies; the bridge never
   distorts a model to force a fit.
7. **No catalogue or relation claims.** This program adds no topics, no
   formalism relations, no atlas edges, and reserves no `fep-NNN`
   identifiers. Future rows arrive only through the existing novelty and
   semantic-review gates.
8. **Inline-code cross-references only.** Cross-repo paths are written as
   code, never as markdown links, because each repository validates links
   independently and relative links across repositories would break on
   either side's hosting.
9. **Mirrored contract.** The canonical contract lives in this directory;
   the mirror lives at
   `GeneralizedNotationNotation/doc/other/fep_lean/bridge-contract.md`.
   Contract edits land in both checkouts in the same working session.
10. **Spec-first lifecycle.** A bounded spec under `specs/` precedes any
    code: no projection module, emitter, or Lean AST lands without an opened
    slice, and the slice's acceptance record owns implementation status.

## Current stage and checklist

- [x] P0 — inventory and bridge contract (this directory).
- [x] P1 — single-model spike: the finite
      `symmetricBoolModel trueBiasedPolicyPrior` instance projected to
      `FepLeanSymmetricBool.md`; strict validation exit 0; 9/9 render
      targets; step 12 executed 9 scripts — 7 rc=0, rxinfer rc=1 (finding
      F1), bnlearn skipped (rendered, not executed)
      ([report](../../../specs/gnn-bridge-p1-finite-spike/REPORT.md)).
- [x] P2 — deterministic projection with a `--check` freshness gate;
      byte-identical regeneration; ruff+mypy clean
      ([report](../../../specs/gnn-bridge-p1-finite-spike/REPORT.md)).
- [x] P3 — certificate protocol run on the P1 instance: C1
      (policy posterior, |Δtrue| = 5.96e-08) and C2 (VFE vs `log 2`,
      |Δ| = 1.91e-09) pass within 1e-6, each with both evidence planes
      labeled; C3 recorded as a conditional boundary; O1 cross-convention
      EFE divergence (pymdp 0.5 vs Lean `log 2`) filed as a finding with
      exact numbers
      ([report](../../../specs/gnn-bridge-p3-certificates/REPORT.md)).
- [x] P4 — closed at the extraction boundary: `F = e^{-1}`,
      `Q = 1 − e^{-2}` are transcendental and the contract's fixed
      rounding policy admits terminating decimals only; documented no-go
      with a recorded unblock path (owner-level rounding extension)
      ([report](../../../specs/gnn-bridge-p4-continuous-spike/REPORT.md));
      **superseded by P4b** — contract v0.2 reopened the phase; scalar-OU
      instance emitted, strict-validated, rendered on all five
      continuous-capable backends, executed on four (pytorch skipped:
      torch absent), discrete-only backends reported `unsupported`
      ([P4b report](../../../specs/gnn-bridge-p4b-continuous-emission/REPORT.md)).
- [x] Q1 — GNN document AST and decidable well-formedness:
      `src/fep_lean/formal/gnn_document.lean` (`FEP.GnnDocument`),
      warning-free, no `sorry`, Init-only, manifest-registered; both
      regeneration gates green
      ([report](../../../specs/gnn-bridge-q1-syntax-ast/REPORT.md)).
- [x] Q2 — discrete-family denotation over `FiniteLaw`/`FiniteKernel`/
      `FiniteHMM`: module `src/fep_lean/formal/gnn_denotation.lean`
      (`FEP.GnnDenotation`), exemplar isomorphism-class statement proved
      warning-free, no `sorry`, no new axioms
      ([report](../../../specs/gnn-bridge-q2-discrete-denotation/REPORT.md)).
- [x] Q3 — continuous-family denotation over `LinearGaussianParameters`:
      module `src/fep_lean/formal/gnn_denotation_continuous.lean`
      (`FEP.GnnContinuous`), prior-gauge convention frozen, exemplar
      statement proved warning-free
      ([report](../../../specs/gnn-bridge-q3-continuous-denotation/REPORT.md)).
- [x] Q4 — renderer and execution statements: module
      `src/fep_lean/formal/gnn_render_statements.lean`
      (`FEP.GnnRenderStatements`), matrix-fragment statements proved per
      statable target, execution semantics proved against `kernelPower`,
      documented no-go rows for the rest
      ([report](../../../specs/gnn-bridge-q4-renderer-execution-statements/REPORT.md)).
- [x] W1 — bridge operations status command (historical):
      `bridge_status.py` composed the accepted slice gates into one surface;
      superseded for operations by W2, whose package implementation it now
      delegates to
      ([report](../../../specs/gnn-bridge-w1-bridge-operations/REPORT.md)).
- [x] W2 — source custody and read-only bridge operations: explicit owner
      snapshot via `fep-lean bridge pin`; emission, status, and certificate
      comparison never repair content drift
      ([report](../../../specs/gnn-bridge-w2-source-custody/REPORT.md)).
- [x] Q5 — concrete PyMDP artifact proof: the five extracted literal tables
      of the retained symmetric runner equal the accepted Q2 payload and its
      carrier masses, with a handcrafted asymmetric control; slice-local
      native probes compiled warning-free with standard axioms only
      ([report](../../../specs/gnn-bridge-q5-artifact-proof/REPORT.md)).

- [x] Q6 — two canonical Julia runners' embedded Boolean tables agree with
      independent symmetric/asymmetric payloads; both positive probes and a
      normalized wrong-axis rejection pass, with a current schema-2 receipt
      ([report](../../../specs/gnn-bridge-q6-activeinference-artifact/REPORT.md)).
- [x] Q7 — decoded scalar-OU coefficients have exact-real approximation and
      prediction bounds; the complete positive axiom census and both coefficient
      negatives pass, with a current schema-2 receipt
      ([report](../../../specs/gnn-bridge-q7-continuous-ou-proof/REPORT.md)).

Opening any unchecked row requires a bounded spec slice per the
[design lifecycle](../README.md).

## Reading order

1. This README.
2. [Bridge contract](bridge-contract.md) — the shared rules both sides honor.
3. [Direction 1](direction-1-lean-to-gnn.md) and
   [Direction 2](direction-2-gnn-to-lean.md).
4. Background: [FEP background](../../fep-background.md) and
   [formal-kernel methods](../../formal-kernel-methods.md); on the GNN side,
   the mirror folder `GeneralizedNotationNotation/doc/other/fep_lean/`.

## Operating the bridge

[W2 source custody](../../../specs/gnn-bridge-w2-source-custody/README.md)
owns the current operations contract. The previous W1 HEAD-refresh procedure
is historical: committing a refresh moved HEAD and immediately staled itself.

Run from the fep_lean checkout, replacing `GNN_PATH` with the explicit GNN root:

```bash
uv run fep-lean bridge pin --gnn-root GNN_PATH
uv run fep-lean bridge emit --gnn-root GNN_PATH --model finite
uv run fep-lean bridge emit --gnn-root GNN_PATH --model continuous
uv run fep-lean bridge status --gnn-root GNN_PATH
uv run fep-lean bridge emit --gnn-root GNN_PATH --model finite --check
uv run fep-lean bridge emit --gnn-root GNN_PATH --model continuous --check
```

Pin only after reviewing the settled owner changes. Pin and emit are explicit
writes; status and `--check` never emit. A provenance-only migration uses
`emit --refresh-digests`; content drift is rejected, not repaired. The pin
records actual owner bytes separately from descriptive commit references.

Use `bridge certify --gnn-root GNN_PATH --results PATH` to compare one
identified result without writing. Add `--receipt PATH` for explicit JSON and
Markdown output, then use `bridge verify-certificate --gnn-root GNN_PATH
--receipt PATH`. Agreement does not establish that the current source produced
an older execution artifact, and never establishes native Lean proof.

Concrete artifact proofs (Q5–Q7) run from the fep_lean checkout against the
current render: `refresh_render.py`, `generate_probe.py`, then
`verify_native.py --compile`, per the
[Q5 reproduction sequence](../../../specs/gnn-bridge-q5-artifact-proof/README.md).
A fresh render invalidates probe and native receipts; regenerate and
recompile in that order.

The old P1/P4b emitter and W1 status script locations remain compatibility
entry points. P3 `certify.py` is a read-only historical numerical comparator
unless `--output PATH` is supplied. Its retained reports are not silently
rewritten by status. Package regression tests run without an adjacent GNN
checkout; live bridge checks require the explicitly named pair.
