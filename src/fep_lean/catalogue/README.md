`FEPTopicCatalogue.default()` loads packaged data with `importlib.resources`, so
the same API works in a checkout and an isolated wheel. `from_yaml(path)` is
available for explicit projections and test fixtures.

`TopicEntry` keeps compile maturity (`mathlib_status`) distinct from semantic
reach (`semantic_disposition`) and exposes the maintained primary theorem,
assumption review, non-vacuity note, and acceptance probe. `summary()` reports
both maturity and semantic totals, including area-level breakdowns.

```python
from fep_lean.catalogue import FEPTopicCatalogue, SemanticDisposition

catalogue = FEPTopicCatalogue.default()
assert catalogue.topics[0].id == "fep-001"
assert catalogue.topics[-1].id == "fep-155"
assert SemanticDisposition.FORMALIZED.value == "formalized"
```

The novelty ledger seals the post-baseline roster and resolves its required
cross-topic theorems before topic projection. The relations ledger is a
separate authored semantic graph: it distinguishes actual derivational
`formal` edges from checked, non-implicational `formal_pairing` edges and
resolves both kinds plus capability witnesses. Its rows are not copied into
`topics.yaml`.

Edit only the maintained inputs, then run the project-root generators and
their `--check` modes. Never hand-edit a generated YAML, aggregate Lean file,
audit table, coverage projection, or atlas.
