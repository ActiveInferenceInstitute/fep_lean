# Fixed-variance scalar Gaussian information geometry

This module owns the nondegenerate scalar Gaussian measure family used by the
smooth Horizon 2 lane. Native Kullback--Leibler divergence remains oriented
from the source law to the reference law and valued in `ℝ≥0∞`. Natural and
mean coordinates are kept distinct through their scores and Fisher values.
Zero variance, multivariate laws, and manifold geometry remain outside this
owner.
