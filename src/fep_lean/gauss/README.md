# `fep_lean.gauss`

SQLite session storage and the strict per-topic Hermes-to-Lean runner. This is
the only package that owns `{GAUSS_HOME}/fep_lean_state.db`.

`OpenGaussClient` stores sessions, turns, artifacts, logs, and the Hermes cache
with WAL mode and foreign keys enabled. `GaussRunner` records one
`TopicRunResult` per selected topic and supports `verify`, `draft`, `prove`, and
`review` prompt workflows. `FEP_LEAN_PREFETCH=1` may overlap provider work for
the next topic with current-topic verification.

`review` is a strict two-turn workflow. The first turn must return a Lean block;
after that exact source compiles, the second turn receives it under a
prose-only prompt. Both turns are stored, separately cached, and required for
workflow success. Compiler warnings remain explicit topic failures even when
Lean returns zero.

`check_gauss_cli(project_root, require=...)` runs `gauss doctor`. Missing or
unhealthy Gauss is advisory when `require=False` and fatal when `require=True`;
full pipeline mode always requires it. There is no environment switch that
turns a requested full run into an offline run—select `mode="catalogue"`
explicitly for offline artifact generation.

```python
from fep_lean.gauss import GaussRunner, OpenGaussClient, TopicRunResult
```

Hermes, refined Lean, fallback, token, model, cache, compiler, `sorry`, warning,
and review-stage outcomes stay separate in `TopicRunResult`; reporters must not
infer success from a partial subset of those fields.
