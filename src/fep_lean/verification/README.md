# `fep_lean.verification`

Lean compilation and read-only capability validation for the standalone
package. This layer does not import the LLM or pipeline packages and never
downloads or builds dependencies during validation.

## Modules

| `environment.py` | Mode-aware `run_validation_checks(project_root, mode=...)` |
| `lean_verifier.py` | `LeanVerifier` and structured `VerifyResult` |
| `formalism_audit.py` | declaration resolution, evidence axiom inspection, and typed audit receipt |
| `_toolchain.py` | Exact pinned executable resolution shared by validation and verification |
| `preflight.py` | Adapter behind `fep-lean preflight` |
| `numerical_witnesses.py` | Typed catalogue and horizon diagnostic registry |
| `_horizon_numerical_witnesses.py` | Scalar terminal and Fin4 numerical calculations |
| `horizon_acceptance.py` | Source-bound H2 terminal and H3.G0 eligibility validation |

| `gnn_artifact_proof.py` | Restricted PyMDP artifact extraction |

## Public boundary

```python
from fep_lean.verification import (
    FormalismAuditResult,
    LeanVerifier,
    VerifyResult,
    run_formalism_audit,
    run_validation_checks,
)
```

`LeanVerifier.verify_sketch(topic_id, lean_code)` writes a bounded temporary
file under the Lake workspace, invokes `lake env lean`, parses errors and
warnings, records `sorry`, and removes the temporary source before returning.
`verify_batch(items)` is deliberately serial because every item shares the same
Lake build tree.

`check_mathlib_built()` returns `(ok, message)`, not compilation evidence. The
native CLI receipt is the full-catalogue evidence boundary:

```bash
uv run fep-lean verify --fail-on-warnings \
  --receipt output/native-verification.json
uv run python scripts/audit_formalisms.py \
  --receipt output/formalism-audit.json
```

The native catalogue receipt and formalism audit answer different questions.
The former compiles all exact topic bodies; the latter resolves every primary
and graph-evidence declaration through the topic aggregate and the manifested
foundation/composition resources imported by `composed.lean`, and
requires a parsed `#print axioms` result for each declaration. Process success
without complete axiom output, actual compiler/pin parity, an exact resolved
Mathlib revision, or live projection parity makes the audit incomplete.
Warnings, `sorryAx`, and any axiom outside the versioned trusted set
(`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`) also fail the audit.

`run_validation_checks` returns named rows appropriate to `catalogue` or
`full` mode. Full mode adds Gauss, writable state, exact toolchain, workspace,
Mathlib, and credential requirements. Callers must inspect the returned status
and rows; the number of checks is not an API constant.

Dependency acquisition is explicit:

```bash
uv run fep-lean setup
uv run fep-lean preflight
```

See the local [agent contract](AGENTS.md) and the package-level
[API reference](../../../docs/api.md).

## Scoped numerical diagnostics

`evaluate_numerical_witnesses(project_root, scope=None)` evaluates the shared
typed registry. `scope="catalogue"` selects the existing 15 family witnesses;
`scope="horizon2"` selects the scalar terminal and Fin4 blanket diagnostics.
The atlas/dashboard and release witness receipt explicitly select catalogue
scope. H2 acceptance consumes the two horizon witnesses through the same
`NumericalCheck` validation and declaration resolver.

The scalar diagnostic follows the selected stationary prior, posterior
variance one half, the local straight natural-gradient line and the finite
one-step diffusion-risk comparison. The Fin4 diagnostic computes its exact
rational covariance from the precision, conditional/perturbed covariance,
and spectral transition identities. These are explanatory numerical checks;
they are not native proofs or empirical FEP validation.

## Concrete artifact receipts

`gnn_artifact_receipt.ArtifactContract` fixes one backend's input, probe and
theorem roster. `ArtifactVerifier` checks content-bound generation and native
transcripts for that contract. Q5/Q6/Q7 slice entry points keep their source
and scientific boundaries explicit. Retained checks do not invoke Lean, a
renderer or a generated runner; `--compile` and render refresh are explicit
operations. Receipt schema 2 also binds the engine, full contract and actual
native command arguments. Extractors imported during retained regeneration
execute their checked source buffers without replacing cached application
modules. Source, toolchain and compiled imports are checked before and after.

The receipt assumes a trusted local checkout and toolchain. It records the
resolved compiler paths, binary hashes and pinned version; it does not
authenticate the host or compiler vendor. Checked local Python generators are
not an execution sandbox for arbitrary programs. Render transcripts retain
captured output, while the verifier independently checks the command, input
and artifact bindings.
